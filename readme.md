# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on data analysis and visualization to extract meaningful insights from structured datasets (e.g., sales, weather, or similar time‑series data). The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize data to support decision‑making through clear metrics and visual outputs.

## Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Generate descriptive and analytical metrics
- Create clear visualizations
- Summarize insights in an easy‑to‑understand format

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
